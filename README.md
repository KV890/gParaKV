## gParaKV: A GPGPU-accelerated Key-value Separation-based KV Store with Optimized Compaction and Garbage Collection

LSM-tree-based key-value stores (KV stores) are widely used in modern cloud storage systems due to their efficient data storage and retrieval capabilities. However, the compaction process in the LSM-tree improves read performance but results in severe write amplification (WA) and write performance bottleneck, especially in the large-sized values cases.
The key-value separation method stores values in a log and their indexes in the LSM-tree, thereby mitigating the WA issue caused by compaction. However, existing key-value separation methods do not fully address the high CPU resource consumption during compaction and expensive garbage collection (GC) for the value log. We propose gParaKV, a GPGPU-empowered KV store with KV separation, which leverages GPGPU parallel technology to accelerate compaction and GC, thereby reducing the high CPU resource consumption. gParaKV features include a GPGPU bitmap structure, parallel data marking, and a parallel GC mechanism. These features help to accelerate the compaction and GC in KV stores, effectively addressing the issue of high CPU resource consumption. Compared with state-of-the-art KV stores, gParaKV improves write and read performance by 2.85x and 1.87x, respectively, and it also reduces CPU utilization by 33.59%.
